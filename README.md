# Global Terrorism Analysis
##   This project will be explored in order to preset the analytical results by getting into the data and further analysis will be done on results. The main purpose of this project is to get some healthy and meaningfull visualizations and trends and make them available for the users  in an understandable format. So, that the end user can work upon the concluded data and will be able to reduce the terrorism.

## Content:
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland. In this project, we are going to analyse the Global Terrorism Data to find out valuable insights.

<h2><b>Steps involved doing this project</b></h2>

<h3><b> Loading and discovering data </b></h3> First step did is loading the raw data from the external source, which in this case is uploaded to the drive. The data is in the format of the CSV (Comma Separated Values) file. So, we uploaded that file into the colab using drive.
<h4><b> Data Cleaning:</b></h4> Data cleaning is an important step in the data analytics process in which you either remove or update information that is incomplete or improperly formatted. Fields like eventid, approxdate, resolution, addnotes, extended, etc. are removed since they are not relevant to the analysis of this project. Fields like having Nan values were handled by replacing Nan values to workable ones. 
<h4><b> Exploratory Data Analysis :</b></h4> In this step, we explored the data by understanding it and do some computations over it and create relevant datafran=mes to be able to plot thm into graphs for the visualization purpose.
<h4><b>	Data Visualization:</b></h4> This is the most important step in which we created graphs to see the results visually and made them end user-ready. This step also helps us to make conclusions out of the explored data as we have stated those below.


## <b>Conclusion</b>
1. Year 2014 had the most number of terror attacks overall. Approximately 17000 attacks in one year. This means that around 47 attacks were happening every single day during that year in multiple locations around the world.
2. Out of all the regions the Middle East & North Africa were the top affected regions. 28.04 % of all events and a staggering 36.47 % of total casualties have been exclusively from these regions.
3. Iraq has been the country with the highest number of attacks and 21.87% of all casualties have been from Iraq.
4. Baghdad has been the most attacked city in the world, 7 of the 26 cities are in Iraq and 4 of the 26 cities are from Pakistan.
5. Bombing/Explosion has been consistently the most popular method of attack over the last 5 decades with 47.7% of all attacks.
6. Taliban has gained much prominence since 2012 and is now responsible for the most number of terror attacks, and the most common attack type used by them are firearms and explosives. This has been the same for the most terrorist group.
7. Around 82000+ attacks were done by unknown groups of gangs, which is a major security concern.
8. Private Citizens and Property are the most attacked targets, followed by the Military, Police, Government, Transportation, etc.
